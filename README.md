# CGL
CGL (C Graphics Library) is a multipurpose library mainly for recreational coding /  demo scenes / prototyping / small games / experimentation. This has a **lot of utilities for graphics**. And best of all all of it is inside a single header file `cgl.h`.  Also CGL is made purely in C but is also compatible with C++. 

**NOTE** : Do not think that header only means its going to increase compile time as the implementation needs be enabled only for 1 file using `#define CGL_IMPLEMENTATION`. See [Examples](./examples)

## What does CGL Provide? 

<details><summary><h3> Know Here </h3></summary>

* Windowing library (Optional)
  - You can completely disable it by `#define CGL_EXCLUDE_WINDOW_API`
  - This windowing library is primarily a wrapper GLFW along with a few extra functionalities. **Example** : In case you are using some library like `nuklear` for GUI it will mess up all `glfw` callbacks so with CGL you can restore the CGL callbacks with a call to `CGL_window_resecure_callbacks`

* Utility functionalities
  - Reading/Writing files
  - Random float/int/bool/vec2/vec3/color generation
  - CRC32/CRC64

  - Batch Renderer backend (very fast even for a large number of widgets)

  - Advanced Bezier Curve( lines or dotted) widget
  - Add individual vertices
  - Adjust stroke color/thickness
  - Customize Batch renderer max vertices capacity (for low memory systems)

* Math library
  - vec2/vec3/vec4
  - mat3/mat4
  - add/sub/mul/div/scale/length/normalize/lerp/min/max/equal for vec2/vec3/vec4
  - rotate_x/rotate_y/rotate_z for vec3

  - perspective for mat4
  - transpose for mat4/(mat3 TODO)
  - Rotation Matrices using Goldman's Method
  - look_at matrix 
  - Quaternion math
  - **NOTE:** Most of math functions are implemented via macros so will be **totally inclined** and quite fast without any unnecessary function calls

* High Level OpenGL API for (Optional)
  - You can completely disable it by `#define CGL_EXCLUDE_GRAPHICS_API`
  - Texture (2D / 2D Array / Cube map) 
  - Framebuffers
  - SSBO (Shader Storage Buffer Object)
  - Shaders 
    - Vertex & Fragment (Geometry Shader not included as its not very widely used)
    - Compute Shader API 

* CGL Mesh API
  - CGL has a high level API for handling meshes
  - 2 types of meshes are there

      - generate triangle
      - generate quad
      - load OBJ (beta)
      - generate cube
      - generate sphere

      - render
      - render instanced
      - render wireframe
      - render wireframe instanced
      
* CGL camera
  - CGL provides a proper camera abstraction
  - Perspective & Orthographic

  - Auto calculates the Up, Right, Front vectors
 
* Text Rendering (Optional) (Requires [FreeType2](http://freetype.org/))

      - enable/disable blinn correction
      - enable/disable depth test
      - enable/disable gamma correction
      - setup ambient lighting
      - add/remove lights

      - Spot (TODO)
    - Phong Material

   - Renders a NxN tilemap with a single line of code
   - Each tile can have following states
     - clear (transparent or disabled)
     - solid color
     - texture -> Texture can be supplied via:
       - texture 2d array -> you need to provide depth for each tile
       - tileset or texture atlas -> you have to provide bounds (normalized 0.0-1.0) of the area of the alas to be used on tile
    - NOTE: this tile render renders only 4 vertices and has only 1 draw call  (not a instanced call so its quite fast
