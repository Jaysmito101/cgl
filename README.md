# CGL
CGL (C Graphics Library) is a multipurpose library mainly for recreational coding /  demo scenes / prototyping / small games / experimentation. This has a **lot of utilities for graphics**. And best of all all of it is inside a single header file `cgl.h`.  Also CGL is made purely in C but is also compatible with C++. 

**NOTE** : Do not think that header only means its going to increase compile time as the implementation needs be enabled only for 1 file using `#define CGL_IMPLEMENTATION`. See [Examples](./examples)

<br>

## Target Platforms

- <b><i>Windows</b></i>
- <b><i>Linux</b></i>
- <b><i>MacOS (untested)</b></i>
- <b><i>WebAssembly (Beta)</b></i>
- <b><i>Android (Coming Soon)</b></i>
